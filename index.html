			<p>Let me tell you a bit about myself! Okay,  so letâ€™s start with the basics. I'm originally from a very small town in the North of Italy called Mondovi and am thereforetechnically Italian, and somehow Australian, but I've only ever been to Australia once and I've spent half of my life living abroad in Spanish-speaking countries, icluding Argentina and Spain. While I do speak 3 languages fluently, French is unfortunately not one of those lol. Aside from that, I consider myself quite extroverted and solar. I also have lots of different interests which you will discover as you scroll down my page!

			<p>I present to you: my second Instagram account and it's feed. This profile paints a very clear picture of my interests. I'm super into fashion, photography, art and good food. I also like to spend an excessive amount of time on Social Media and love going out a little too much... all of which you can clearly see right here</p>

			<p>Throughout my life I have been very lucky to be given the chance to travel all around the world. I've explored 6 continents and been to over 30 countries. I love travelling and exploring new places. I firmly believe that any excuse is a valid excuse catch a flight. </p>
